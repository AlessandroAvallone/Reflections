How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Having highlighten only the lines with actual changes, made easier to spot the typo 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    In case of bug could easily make me find the the problem in the sections where changes were made.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    If I choose manually I can save a file just before attempting some changing and everytime I made a logical
    change.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because some files in coding can be interconnected like
    an HTML and a CSS file of a website, and changes can affect all files.
    A commit save all the files in the repository.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I can use "git log" on a directory to view the entire commits history.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I know that I can alway go back and find where the error was made and eventually roll back.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    It's required for the course I want to take
